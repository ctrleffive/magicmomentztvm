We work in a unique way with our clients. It all starts with a\r\nconversation with them. We strive to best understand what they are\r\nactually looking for. This helps us to know their personalities and allows\r\nus to tell their wedding story in the best possible way.</p>\r\n<p>While we have a style which we would describe as vibrant, colourful and\r\nbold – we are also very flexible and listen to what our bride and grooms\r\nreally want rather than force our style upon them. We are well aware that\r\nevery couple is different and when some want significant focus on them\r\nand their portraits, others want a more laid back and reportage\r\napproach. It’s quite easy and natural for us to adapt to your\r\nrequirements so that you always feel comfortable.</p>\r\n<h2>Our Team</h2>\r\n<p>Located at Kazhakuttom in the capital city of Kerala, we boast of having\r\nvery highly experienced, skilled, and professional photographers in our\r\nteam.
